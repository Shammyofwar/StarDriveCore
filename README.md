# StarDrive Core
StarDrive Core provides ship system functionality. In-development features are ship-to-ship crew  and resources without transport docking, Auto hover (PID Controller) for on-the-fly at-will hovering, and more! This plug-in is being  built exclusively for our mod Scifi Shipyards Redux and we have no plans at this time to release it as a stand-alone mod.
